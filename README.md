# PAW-FetchFromDBDynamicValue

A [Paw](https://paw.cloud/) extension to fetch value from a database (currently limited to [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)).


**Important Note:**
> I still need to figure out and fix the 'No Module Named' error. My guess is PAW's extensions use 'target': 'web', and this limit the use of backend related modules/packages...
